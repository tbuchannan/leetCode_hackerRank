 *
 * It is a concatenation of one or more words consisting of English letters.
 * All letters in the first word are lowercase.
 * For each of the subsequent words, the first letter is uppercase and rest of the letters are lowercase.
 * Given "s", print the number of words in "s" on a new line.
 *
 * Sample Input
