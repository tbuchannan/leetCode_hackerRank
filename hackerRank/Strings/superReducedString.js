/*
 * Steve has a string, "s", consisting of  lowercase English alphabetic letters. In
 * one operation, he can delete any pair of adjacent letters with same value. For
 * example, string "aabcc" would become either "aab" or "bcc" after operation.
 *
 * Steve wants to reduce "s" as much as possible. To do this, he will repeat the above
 * operation as many times as it can be performed. Help Steve out by finding and
 * printing "s"'s non-reducible form!
 *
 * If the final string is empty, print Empty String; otherwise, print the final non-reducible string.
 *
 * superReducedString(aaabccddd) #=> 'abd'
 *
 * aaabccddd → abccddd
 * abccddd → abddd
 * abddd → abd
 *
 * superReducedString(baab) #=> 'Empty String'
 *
 * baab → bb
 * bb → Empty String
